    "\n",
    "At their core, Large Language Models are **inherently stateless**. Their awareness is confined to the information you provide in a single API call. This means an agent without proper context management will react to the current prompt without considering any previous history.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.2 What is a Session?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **📦 Session**\n",
    "\n",
    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "In ADK, a **Session** is comprised of two key components `Events` and `State`:\n",

    "> While a session is a container for conversations, `Events` are the building blocks of a conversation.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Example of Events:\n",
    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",
    "> - *Tool Output*: The data returned from a tool call, which the agent uses to continue its reasoning\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**{} Session.State**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `session.state` is the Agent's scratchpad, where it stores and updates dynamic details needed during the conversation. Think of it as a global `{key, value}` pair storage which is available to all subagents and tools.\n",

      "Let me elaborate on what it entails and why it's so significant:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is Generative AI for Molecule Design?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, drug discovery involved:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Target Identification:** Finding a specific biological molecule (like a protein) involved in a disease.\n",
      "2.  **Library Screening:** Taking a massive \"library\" of millions of existing chemical compounds and testing each one to see if it binds to the target. This is a bit like trying to find a specific key by trying every key in a giant keyring.\n",
      "3.  **Lead Optimization:** Once a promising \"hit\" compound is found, medicinal chemists try to modify it to improve its properties (efficacy, safety, how well it's absorbed, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Generative AI flips this process on its head.** Instead of screening existing molecules, it *creates* new ones from scratch. Here's how it generally works:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Learning the Rules of Chemistry:** Generative AI models (often based on deep learning architectures like variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks) are trained on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties. They learn the fundamental \"rules\" of chemical structure, bonding, and how different structures relate to biological activity.\n",
      "*   **Designing from Scratch (De Novo Design):** Once trained, these models can be given specific parameters or constraints related to a target disease or desired drug properties. For example, you might tell the AI:\n",
      "    *   \"Design a molecule that binds strongly to protein X.\"\n",
      "    *   \"Design a molecule that inhibits enzyme Y.\"\n",
      "    *   \"Design a molecule that has low predicted toxicity and good oral bioavailability.\"\n",
      "*   **Outputting Novel Structures:** The AI then generates entirely novel chemical structures that it \"believes\" will meet these requirements. These are not just slight variations of existing molecules; they can be completely new chemical entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is This Development So Significant?**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Speed:** It dramatically accelerates the initial stages of drug discovery. Instead of months or years of screening, you can potentially generate a list of promising drug candidates in days or weeks.\n",
      "2.  **Novelty:** It allows for the exploration of chemical space that might never have been considered by human chemists. This increases the chances of finding truly breakthrough drugs for challenging diseases.\n",
      "3.  **Optimization from the Start:** The AI can be programmed to design molecules that *already* possess desirable properties, rather than finding a \"dirty\" molecule and trying to clean it up. This can lead to drugs with better safety profiles and efficacy from the outset.\n",
      "4.  **Addressing \"Undruggable\" Targets:** Some biological targets are notoriously difficult to hit with traditional small molecules. Generative AI can be trained to design more creative and specific chemical entities that might be able to interact with these complex targets.\n",
      "5.  **Reduced Cost:** By speeding up the process and potentially reducing the number of failed experiments, generative AI can help lower the immense cost associated with drug discovery and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analogies to Help Understand:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **An Architect Designing a House:** Instead of looking at existing house blueprints and picking one, an AI architect can be told the requirements (number of rooms, style, budget, location) and design a completely new house from the ground up.\n",
      "*   **A Composer Writing Music:** Instead of remixing existing songs, a generative AI composer can create entirely new melodies and harmonies based on learned musical principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Current State and Future Potential:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Emerging Companies:** Many innovative biotech startups are built around this technology (e.g., Insilico Medicine, Exscientia, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Atomwise).\n",
      "*   **Big Pharma Partnerships:** Major pharmaceutical companies are actively partnering with or acquiring these AI-driven companies to leverage this capability.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Progress:** Several AI-designed molecules are now in various stages of clinical trials, a testament to the technology's maturity.\n",
      "*   **Further Refinements:** Researchers are continually improving the AI models to make them more accurate, more efficient, and capable of designing even more complex and sophisticated molecules.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, generative AI for molecule design is transforming drug discovery from a process of extensive searching to one of intelligent creation, holding immense promise for developing new medicines faster and more effectively.\n",
      "\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n",
    "2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n",

    "In this notebook, we manually identified a couple characteristic (username and country) and built tools to manage it. But real conversations involve hundreds of such characteristics:\n",
    "- User preferences and habits\n",
    "- Past interactions and their outcomes\n",
    "- Domain knowledge and expertise levels\n",
    "- Communication styles and patterns\n",
    "- Contextual relationships between topics\n",

    "**The Memory System in ADK automates this entire process**, making it a valuable asset for building truly Context-Aware Agents that can accommodate any user's current and future needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook (Part 2: Memory Management), you'll learn how to:\n",
    "- Enable automatic memory extraction from conversations\n",
    "- Build agents that learn and adapt over time\n",
    "- Create truly personalized experiences at scale\n",
    "- Manage long-term knowledge across sessions\n",
