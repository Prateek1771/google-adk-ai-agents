    "# 🚀 Multi-Agent Systems & Workflow Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Agents course!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, you built a **single agent** that could take action. Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",
    "- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n",

    "> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n",
    "> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)\n",

      "\n",
      "## Headline: **Unleash the Power of Collaboration: Why Multi-Agent Systems are Your Next Software Development Superpower**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Introduction Hook:\n",
      "Imagine building complex software not as a single, monolithic effort, but as a symphony of specialized, intelligent components working harmoniously. That's the promise of multi-agent systems (MAS), and for software developers, it's a paradigm shift that can unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency, robustness, and innovation. Are you ready to explore how this collaborative approach can revolutionize your development process?\n",
      "\n",
      "### Main Sections:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Enhanced Modularity and Maintainability: Building Blocks for Success**\n",
      "    *   **Decomposition into Smaller, Manageable Units:** MAS allows you to break down large, intricate problems into smaller, independent \"agent\" responsibilities. This makes each piece of code easier to understand, develop, and test.\n",
      "    *   **Easier Debugging and Troubleshooting:** When a problem arises, it's often isolated to a specific agent's functionality. This drastically reduces the scope of debugging, saving valuable time and frustration.\n",
      "    *   **Independent Development and Upgrades:** Agents can be developed, tested, and updated in parallel by different teams or individuals without significant impact on other parts of the system, fostering agile workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Increased Robustness and Resilience: A System That Bounces Back**\n",
      "    *   **Fault Tolerance and Graceful Degradation:** If one agent fails, others can often compensate for its loss or perform essential functions, preventing a complete system collapse. This leads to more reliable and fault-tolerant applications.\n",
      "    *   **Decentralized Control and Autonomy:** Agents can operate autonomously, making decisions based on their local environment and goals. This distributed nature reduces single points of failure and enhances adaptability.\n",
      "    *   **Self-Healing and Adaptation Capabilities:** Advanced MAS can be designed to detect and recover from errors, or even adapt their behavior in response to changing conditions or unexpected events.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Improved Scalability and Performance: Growing Without Breaking**\n",
      "    *   **Parallel Processing and Distributed Workloads:** Agents can execute tasks concurrently, distributing the computational load across multiple resources. This is crucial for handling large datasets and high transaction volumes.\n",
      "    *   **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Agents can be dynamically added or removed from the system as demand fluctuates, allowing for efficient resource utilization and cost-effectiveness.\n",
      "    *   **Specialized Task Optimization:** Different agents can be optimized for specific tasks, leading to higher performance in their respective domains and overall system efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Fostering Innovation and Complex Problem Solving: Thinking Beyond the Ordinary**\n",
      "    *   **Modeling Complex Real-World Scenarios:** MAS excel at simulating and managing systems with many interacting entities, such as supply chains, traffic simulations, or smart grids.\n",
      "    *   **Emergent Behavior and Unexpected Solutions:** The interaction of multiple independent agents can lead to emergent behaviors and solutions that might not have been explicitly programmed, fostering creativity and novel approaches.\n",
      "    *   **Facilitating Human-Agent Collaboration:** MAS opens doors for more sophisticated human-computer interaction, where agents act as intelligent assistants or partners in complex decision-making processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Concluding Thought:\n",
      "The era of monolithic software is fading. By embracing multi-agent systems, software developers are not just adopting a new architectural pattern; they are equipping themselves with a powerful framework for building smarter, more resilient, and more scalable applications. Start exploring the world of MAS today and unlock the full potential of collaborative software development.\n",

Are you ready to explore how this collaborative approach can revolutionize your development process?\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most significant advantages of MAS is **enhanced modularity and maintainability**. By decomposing large problems into smaller, independent \"agent\" responsibilities, each piece of code becomes easier to understand, develop, and test. Debugging becomes a breeze, as issues are often isolated to specific agents, drastically reducing troubleshooting time. Furthermore, agents can be developed and updated in parallel, fostering agile workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond maintainability, MAS dramatically increases **robustness and resilience**. If one agent fails, others can often compensate, preventing a complete system collapse. This decentralized control and autonomy make systems more adaptable and less prone to single points of failure. Advanced MAS can even exhibit self-healing and adaptation capabilities, making your applications more reliable.\n",

      "InitialWriterAgent > Old Silas polished the lantern glass, its beam cutting a familiar swathe through the inky black. Forty years he'd kept this light, the rhythm of the waves his only constant companion. Tonight, however, something was different. Tucked beneath a loose stone by the door, a rolled parchment shimmered. Unfurling it, Silas gasped. It wasn't paper, but some yielding, leathery material, covered in symbols that pulsed with an inner, cerulean light. Lines of luminescence traced coastlines he didn't recognize, dotted with islands that seemed to float, untethered. One symbol, a swirling vortex, glowed brighter than the rest, beckoning him. The sea outside, usually a dull roar, now whispered promises of an uncharted world.\n",
      "CriticAgent > This is a very promising start to a story, full of atmosphere and intrigue. Here are a few suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Develop Silas's internal reaction and motivation more:** While Silas \"gasped,\" we don't yet see much of his personality or what this discovery *means* to him. After forty years of routine, is he fearful, excited, bewildered, or a mix? Giving him a stronger internal monologue or a physical reaction beyond a gasp would make him a more relatable character and heighten the stakes of his discovery. For example, does he immediately think of a legend, a lost love, or a lifelong dream of adventure?\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Flesh out the map's description and its immediate effect:** The description of the map is good, but could be even more evocative. Instead of just \"coastlines he didn't recognize,\" could there be a specific, alien detail? Do the floating islands have strange geological formations? Also, how does the map *physically* affect Silas or his surroundings beyond the whispering sea? Does it warm his hands, make the air crackle, or cause the lantern light to flicker in response?\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hint at the nature of the \"uncharted world\":** The whispering sea promises an uncharted world, but it's still quite abstract. Even a small detail that hints at the *type* of world would add more immediate intrigue. Is it a world of magic, advanced technology, or something entirely alien? Perhaps the vortex symbol itself suggests a mode of travel or a danger.\n",
      "RefinerAgent > Old Silas polished the lantern glass, its beam cutting a familiar swathe through the inky black. Forty years he'd kept this light, the rhythm of the waves his only constant companion. Forty years of predictable tides, of familiar stars, of the same lonely horizon. Tonight, however, a tremor ran through the stoic routine. Tucked beneath a loose stone by the door, a rolled parchment shimmered, an anomaly in the dim, salt-laced air. His gnarled fingers, accustomed to the rough stone and smooth glass, trembled as he unfurled it. A gasp escaped him, a sound swallowed by the sudden, profound silence that fell over the lighthouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't paper. It felt like cured sharkskin, yielding yet resilient, and it pulsed with an inner, cerulean light that made Silas’s aged eyes water. Symbols, alien and intricate, writhed across its surface. Lines of luminescence traced coastlines he’d never seen, not on any chart in his possession. Islands, wreathed in swirling, opalescent clouds, seemed to float untethered above a sea of swirling nebulae. One symbol, a vortex of impossible depth, glowed brighter than the rest, and as Silas’s gaze locked onto it, a warmth spread from the parchment into his hands, then up his arms. The air in the lantern room grew thick, crackling with unseen energy, and the steady beam of his lighthouse flickered as if in response to the map's alien power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sea outside, usually a dull, rhythmic roar, now whispered. But it wasn't the familiar whisper of the tides. This was a chorus of alien voices, promising not just an uncharted world, but a world unbound by earthly laws. The vortex symbol seemed to spin faster, and Silas felt a strange pull, a yearning he hadn't felt since he was a boy dreaming of sailing beyond the known world. Was this a gateway? A new form of magic, or perhaps remnants of a civilization that had mastered the very fabric of space? The whispering sea offered no answers, only an invitation to step into the luminous unknown.\n",

    "## ✅ Congratulations! You're Now an Agent Orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n",
    "\n",
    "You used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n",
